Software Testing basics
=======================

The Coderefinery project has given (in March 2021) a great workshop on software testing.
Our focus is a bit different on the practical part, but for concepts and motivation,
`their material <https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/>`_ is great.

The material has an `open license <https://github.com/coderefinery/testing/blob/main/LICENSE>`_ and can thus be freely used
as basis for derivative work. We just link directly to the sections we want here, because they are great as it is.

* `Coderefinery's motivations for testing <https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/motivation/>`_
* `Coderefinery's basic testing concepts <https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/concepts/>`_


Before we meet online: Test design
----------------------------------
Besides the concepts and motivation, Coderefinery has a good section about **test design**.

Since our workshop is based on hands-on tutoring, we ask you to read that section and try to apply the ideas to your project.
Then on the online session we will follow up and discuss / help you with your problems.

* `Coderefinery's section on test design <https://coderefinery.github.io/testing/test-design/>`_

Maybe not all topics are applicable to your project (external dependencies, randomness), but try to apply those that are.
